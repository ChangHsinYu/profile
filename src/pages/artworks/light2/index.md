      LED lights flash continuously at a speed that is unrecognizable to our eye. There may be some messages hidden in the flickering, from the future or the past, from here or distance. The glimmer is the vibration lingering in the tranquility, carrying residue and imagination.<br>
From the lonely late night to the early morning when people start to work, the sound outside the window can often bring me back to reality from the huge pressure at work. The lonely and tense mental state when I was creating also became loosened as the outside world began to move. The sound of wind serves as the background, the birds in the sky sing at high frequency, the iron gate is pulled up, the pace of pedestrians on the street is busy but harmonious, and the gradually increasing traffic flow is like a steady low-frequency sound... What I make in the living room is electronic sounds that lead to fiction spaces in the universe. There is a strong contrast between the two, but creating a wonderful balance in the same scene. In the process of creating at night, I often deny the things I make, feeling that no matter what I do, they are not good enough, but they often gradually ferment when the sun rises. I don’t know whether it is a kind of relief that the time is approaching and I can’t make it back, or whether it is the original feelings are just the result of negative emotions in the dark.<br>"Listen to the Light - Routing" With the theme of daily life, I hid the recent recurring experiences in the luminous objects in the space. In order to allow viewers to explore these signals that are silently carried in the light, I made a detector which could receives the light source through the solar panel, converts the fluctuations of the light into electrical signals, and then amplifies them into sounds that can be directly felt.<br>

        現實世界中的Led燈，以肉眼無法辨識的速度不斷地閃動。閃爍之中或許隱藏著某些訊息，來自未來或過去、來自此地或彼端，物件及痕跡中的微光是滯留於寧靜中的震動，乘載著殘留與想像。<br>從寂寥的深夜到人們逐漸開工的清晨，窗外的聲音往往能把我從工作中的巨量壓力拉回現實，原本創作時孤獨緊繃的心理狀態也隨著外面的世界開始運轉有些鬆脫。風聲作為背景，天上的小鳥以高頻鳴唱，鐵門拉起，街道上行人的步伐忙碌卻和諧，逐漸增加的車流像穩重的低頻聲線......。在客廳的我製作的則是通往宇宙異空間的電子聲響。兩者之間有著強烈對比，卻在同一個場景中創造了奇妙的平衡。夜晚創作的過程中我常常否定自己做的東西，覺得怎麼做都不夠好，但他們卻常常在太陽升起時逐漸發酵，不知道是一種時間將近而我無力回天的釋懷，還是原先的感受只是處於黑暗的負面情緒作祟。<br>Listen to the Light - Routing 以日常為題，我將上述在近期不斷循環的經驗藏匿在展場的發光體中，為了讓觀者能夠探尋這些默默被夾帶在燈光中的訊號，我自製了一個探測器，透過太陽能板接收光源，並將光的波動轉換成電訊號，再將其放大成可直接感受到的聲音。<br>
