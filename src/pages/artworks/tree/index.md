        In electricity, magnetism, sound, and light, vibration, wave, and particles all play the role of transmitting signals. Due to the limitation of receivers, we can never fully receive cosmos-traversing signals. Although human beings have never stopped finding ways to survey the world, there are always unknown signals that are enchanting. Tree Noise resembles a survey of living organisms-it uses vibration detection to locate secret messages passing within and through plants. The mushroom-shaped device in the work receives sounds from within trees, and forms complicated neural networks among them. The installation, which looks like an enormous fungus, coexists with the trees, using sounds as its nutrients and carrying with it the pulses of trees as well as the unique sounds from surrounding animals and the changing environment.<br>

      電、磁、聲音和光，震動、波與粒子無不扮演著傳遞訊息的角色，因受器的限制我們永遠無法完整接收穿梭於宇宙中的暗號。儘管如此人類卻沒有停止想方設法對世界進行探測，未知的訊號總是迷人！這件作品可以視為對生命體的探測，試圖利用偵測震動的方式找出植物體內的秘密訊息，作品中的蕈狀裝置接收到來自樹木內部的聲音，並在彼此間形成複雜的神經網路。這些猶如大型真菌的裝置以聲音作為養分與樹木共生，承載著樹木的脈搏以及周圍動物、環境變化的特殊聲響。<br>
